This folder contains anonymized, self-contained versions of our Observable
notebooks.  These versions of the notebooks were created by using Observable's
default export functionality. Note that Observable only exports the output of
each cell, so if you want to see the origianl code from the example, you need
to look at the .js files generated by Observable (they have randomized names).

All of the notebooks are compressed, so to run them you need to decompress them
first. Here's an example with the `pyxis-analytic-knowledge` notebook:
```
tar -xzf pyxis-analytic-knowledge-anonymized.tgz
```

This will generate a folder called `pyxis-analytic-knowledge`. To run the
Observable environment, we created a bash script you can use. To run a
particular (decompressed) notebook, e.g., the
pyxis-analytic-knowledge-notebook, you can use the following:
```
./run-notebook.sh pyxis-analytic-knowledge
```

This will run a Python SimpleHTTPServer at localhost:8000. You just visit
localhost:8000 in the browser (we tested with Chrome) to view the notebook
output. You have to kill the Python server process in order to run a different
notebook.
