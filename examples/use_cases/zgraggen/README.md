# Recreating Zgraggen et al. Insights

We had to create our own sleep dataset to recreate some insights. This is
`sleep_sample.csv`. We used the code referenced in Zgraggen et al. (the Macau
project, see `data_generator.py` from [this
repository](https://github.com/zheguang/macau/blob/master/data_generator.py))
to generate a larger dataset file with 300 rows (as done in the original
experiment). This is `sleep_generated.csv`.
