This example uses log data collected by Battle & Heer, based on their paper:
* Battle, L. and Heer, J., 2019, June. Characterizing exploratory visual analysis: A literature review and evaluation of analytic provenance in tableau. In Computer graphics forum (Vol. 38, No. 3, pp. 145-159).

The github repository containing the log data is [here](https://github.com/leibatt/characterizing-eva-tableau). In this example, we recreate participants' answers to tasks from the Battle & Heer study, specifically for tasks regarding the birdstrikes dataset (see the dataset folder for more details). The task answers are located in [this file](https://github.com/leibatt/characterizing-eva-tableau/blob/master/code/answer_types.csv) in their repository.

Additional information about the birdstrikes dataset is available in `birdstrikes_supplement.pdf` in this folder (also from Battle & Heer).
